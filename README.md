# Tetris Game

Tetris is a timeless and highly addictive puzzle game that has stood the test of time. In this game, players must arrange falling tetrominoes (shapes made up of four blocks) in such a way that they form complete horizontal lines on the game board. The goal is to clear these lines by filling them entirely with blocks, which results in them disappearing, earning the player points.

The game is set on a 10x20 grid, where tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen. The player can move the pieces left, right, or down, and also rotate them to fit the available spaces. As the game progresses, the speed at which the pieces fall gradually increases, making it more challenging for the player to keep up with the pace.

Each time a horizontal line is filled completely, it disappears, and the player is awarded points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the screen, leaving no room for new pieces to fall. The player's goal is to clear as many lines as possible before the game ends.
